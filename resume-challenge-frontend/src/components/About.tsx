        I’m a versatile Cloud Engineer and Full Stack Developer with a
        background in mobile and web development. Over the last few years, I’ve
        transitioned from iOS and full stack development into cloud
        architecture, focusing on building secure, scalable, and automated
        solutions using AWS and Infrastructure as Code. I enjoy solving complex
        system design challenges, creating developer tools, and continuously
        improving deployment pipelines and cloud infrastructure.
